# AnsibleHound

![](./images/ansiblehound.png)

## Overview

**AnsibleHound** is a BloodHound OpenGraph collector for **Ansible WorX** and **Ansible Tower**. The collector is designed to map the structure and permission of your organization into a navigable attackâ€‘path graph.

Developped by [@Ramoreik](https://github.com/Ramoreik) and [@s_lck](https://github.com/s-lck).

## Collector Setup & Usage

### Creating a token

To obtain a valid token for **Ansible WorX** or **Ansible Tower**, you can navigate to the **User Details** of your current user.

Then the **tokens** tab.

Finally, create a token and give it **Read** permissions.

### Building the tool

```bash
go build . -o build/collector
```

### Running the Collection

You can run the collector by providing it a **target** and a **token**. It will enumerate what it can give the user's access.

```bash
./collector -u '<ansible-url>' -t '<token>'

# Example
./collector -u 'http://localhost:8080/' -t '56KOmh...'
```

> Note : If you have multiple instances of Ansible you need to run the collector against each of them

### Load Icons

A script is provided to import the icon for the custom nodes used by AnsibleHound.
You have to provide it the `bloodhound-url` and `jwt-token`.

```bash
python3 ./scripts/import-icons.py <bloodhound-url> <jwt-token>

# Example
python3 ./scripts/import-icons.py 'http://localhost:8080' 'ey[...]'
```

### Samples

If you don't have any Ansible WorX or Tower environment, you can just drop `./samples/example.json` on BHCE to enjoy the graph.
